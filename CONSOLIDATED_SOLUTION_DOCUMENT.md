## Technical Architecture

### Data Model Design

#### Audit__c (Master Object)
Central audit tracking entity with comprehensive field coverage:

| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Parent_Type__c | Picklist | Object type (Lead, Opportunity) |
| Parent_Lead__c | Lookup (Lead) | Reference to Lead |
| Parent_Opportunity__c | Lookup (Opportunity) | Reference to Opportunity |
| Opportunity_Stage__c | Text | Opportunity Stage value at time of audit |
| Lead_Status__c | Text | Lead Status value at time of audit |
| Audit_Status__c | Picklist | Audit status (Draft, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled) |
| Audit_Type__c | Picklist | Audit type (Pre-Sale, During-Sale, Post-Sale) |
| Expected_Audit_Date__c | Date | Planned date for the audit |
| Actual_Audit_Date__c | Date | Date the audit was performed |
| Comments__c | Long Text | Notes and observations |
| Overdue__c | Formula (Checkbox) | Auto-calculated: `AND(NOT(ISBLANK(Expected_Audit_Date__c)), TODAY() > Expected_Audit_Date__c, NOT(ISPICKVAL(Audit_Status__c, "Completed")), NOT(ISPICKVAL(Audit_Status__c, "Cancelled")))` |
| Original_Owner__c | Lookup (User) | Original owner of the parent record |

#### Audit_Participant__c (Junction Object)
Flexible participant management supporting internal and external stakeholders:

| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Audit__c | Lookup (Audit__c) | Reference to the Audit record |
| Contact__c | Lookup (Contact) | Reference to the Contact (external participant) |
| User__c | Lookup (User) | Reference to the User (internal participant) |
| Role__c | Picklist | Role in the audit (Owner, Client, Auditor, etc.) |
| Comments__c | Long Text | Optional notes |

**Validation Rule**: Ensures either User__c OR Contact__c is populated (not both).

#### AuditConfig__mdt (Configuration Management)
Metadata-driven business rules enabling admin flexibility:

| Field API Name | Type | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| ObjectType__c | Picklist | Opportunity, Lead |
| Stage__c | Picklist | For Opportunities: Qualification, Proposal/Price Quote, etc. |
| Status__c | Picklist | For Leads: Working - Contacted, Closed - Not Converted |

Stage Change   System Process      System Process      User Action    User Action
```

#### Audit Types & Triggers

| Audit Type | Business Purpose | Trigger Events | Typical Duration |
|------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Pre-Sale** | Lead qualification validation | Lead status changes | 10 days |
| **During-Sale** | Opportunity progression review | Opportunity stage advancement | 7 days |
| **Post-Sale** | Deal closure compliance | Opportunity closure (Won/Lost) | 5 days |

### Opportunity Audit Process

#### Trigger Conditions
The system automatically creates audits when an Opportunity advances to these stages:
- **Qualification**: During-Sale audit (7 days to complete)
- **Proposal/Price Quote**: During-Sale audit (7 days to complete)
- **Negotiation/Review**: During-Sale audit (7 days to complete)
- **Closed Won**: Post-Sale audit (5 days to complete)
- **Closed Lost**: Post-Sale audit (5 days to complete)

#### Automatic Participant Assignment

**For All Opportunity Audits**:
1. **Opportunity Owner** (Role: Owner)
   - Primary responsibility for audit completion
   - Receives all audit-related notifications
   - Can delegate but remains accountable

2. **Account Owner** (Role: Owner) - *if different from Opportunity Owner*
   - Secondary ownership responsibility
   - Provides account context and history
   - Collaborates on audit completion

3. **Account Contacts** (Role: Client)
   - External stakeholders in the audit process
   - May be requested to provide information
   - Receive relevant audit communications

#### Owner Responsibilities

**Upon Audit Creation**:
1. **Review Audit Details**: Understand scope and requirements
2. **Validate Participants**: Ensure all relevant parties are included
3. **Plan Audit Activities**: Schedule review meetings and documentation
4. **Set Expectations**: Communicate timeline to all participants

**During Audit Execution**:
1. **Document Activities**: Record all audit-related activities in Comments
2. **Collaborate with Participants**: Engage Account Owner and Contacts as needed
3. **Address Issues**: Resolve any findings or discrepancies
4. **Monitor Timeline**: Track progress against expected completion date

**Upon Audit Completion**:
1. **Update Status**: Change Audit Status to 'Completed'
2. **Record Actual Date**: Enter Actual_Audit_Date__c
3. **Summarize Findings**: Document key outcomes in Comments
4. **Share Results**: Communicate findings to management if required

### Lead Audit Process

#### Trigger Conditions
The system automatically creates audits when a Lead changes to these statuses:
- **Working - Contacted**: Pre-Sale audit (10 days to complete)
- **Closed - Not Converted**: Pre-Sale audit (10 days to complete)

#### Lead Owner Responsibilities

**For Working - Contacted Audits**:
1. **Validate Engagement**: Confirm meaningful contact was made
2. **Review Qualification**: Assess lead quality and fit
3. **Document Activities**: Record all engagement activities
4. **Plan Next Steps**: Define follow-up strategy

**For Closed - Not Converted Audits**:
1. **Analyze Failure**: Identify reasons for non-conversion
2. **Document Lessons**: Record insights for future improvement
3. **Validate Decision**: Confirm closure was appropriate
4. **Report Trends**: Share patterns with management

### Overdue Audit Management

#### Overdue Detection Logic
An audit is automatically flagged as overdue when:
- Expected Audit Date has passed (TODAY() > Expected_Audit_Date__c)
- Audit Status is NOT 'Completed' or 'Cancelled'
- The Overdue__c formula field displays as TRUE

#### Escalation Process

**Day 1 (Overdue)**:
- Audit Owner receives automated reminder
- Overdue flag visible on audit record
- Manager can view overdue audits via reports

**Day 3 (Significantly Overdue)**:
- Manager receives escalation notification
- Audit appears on management dashboard
- Required review between Manager and Owner

**Day 7 (Critical Overdue)**:
- Senior management notification
- Formal review process initiated
- Audit may be reassigned or cancelled
