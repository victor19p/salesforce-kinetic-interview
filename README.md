# Sales Audit Tracking Solution for Salesforce

## Overview

A comprehensive audit tracking system implemented in Salesforce to replace manual sales audit processes. This solution provides complete visibility into audit lifecycles, supports multiple concurrent audit types, and automatically flags overdue audits for timely action.

**Status: IMPLEMENTED** ✅

The system is fully functional with automated audit creation, participant management, and configurable business rules via custom metadata.

## Core Requirements Met

✅ **Audit Lifecycle Visibility**: Complete tracking with `Audit_Status__c` and participant management  
✅ **Multiple Concurrent Audits**: Pre-sale, During-sale, and Post-sale audit types supported  
✅ **Multiple Contact Association**: Junction object allows unlimited participants per audit  
✅ **Overdue Audit Flagging**: Sophisticated formula field automatically identifies overdue audits

| Original_Owner__c           | Lookup (User)               | Original owner of the parent record |

---

### **Audit_Participant__c (Junction Object)**

| Field Name           | Data Type                 | Description                                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Audit__c             | Lookup (Audit__c)        | Reference to the Audit record                           |

**Validation Rule:**  
Require that either `User__c` or `Contact__c` is populated, but not both.

## Implementation Architecture

### **Trigger Framework**
- **OpportunityAuditTrigger** → **OpportunityAuditTriggerHandler**
- **LeadAuditTrigger** → **LeadAuditTriggerHandler**
- Centralized business logic in **AuditService** class
- Participant management via **AuditParticipantService** class

### **Automated Participant Creation**
The system automatically creates audit participants:
- **Opportunity Audits**: Opportunity Owner, Account Owner (if different), Account Contacts
- **Lead Audits**: Lead Owner
- **Roles**: 'Owner' for internal users, 'Client' for contacts

### **Record Types**
- **Lead_Audit**: For Lead-related audits
- **Opportunity_Audit**: For Opportunity-related audits

---

## Automation Logic

### **Trigger-Based Audit Creation**
- **On Insert**: Creates audit if the initial Stage/Status matches active configuration
- **On Update**: Creates audit only if Stage/Status actually changes to a configured value
- **Bulk Safe**: Handles multiple records efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with debug logging

### **Business Logic Flow**
1. Trigger fires on Lead/Opportunity change
2. AuditService checks if Stage/Status matches AuditConfig__mdt
3. If match found and IsActive__c = true:
   - Create Audit__c record with expected date
   - AuditParticipantService creates relevant participants
4. All DML operations are bulkified and error-handled

---

## AuditConfig__mdt: Custom Metadata Configuration

Manages audit rules for Opportunities and Leads via admin configuration—no code changes required.

Any user with the Customize Application permission can edit the values of these metadata records.  
Changes made in your org will not be overwritten by managed package upgrades.

## Implementation Classes

### **AuditService.cls**
Core business logic for audit creation and management.

**Key Methods:**
- `createAuditForOpportunity()` - Handles Opportunity audit creation
- `createAuditForLead()` - Handles Lead audit creation  
- `detectFieldChangeAndAudit()` - Generic field change detection
- `getAuditConfig()` - Retrieves metadata configuration

### **AuditParticipantService.cls**
Manages automatic participant creation for audits.

**Key Methods:**
- `processAuditParticipants()` - Main orchestration method
- `buildAuditParticipants()` - Creates participant records based on audit type
- `fetchOpportunities/Leads/Accounts/Contacts()` - Bulk data retrieval

### **Trigger Handlers**
- `OpportunityAuditTriggerHandler.cls` - Handles Opportunity triggers
- `LeadAuditTriggerHandler.cls` - Handles Lead triggers
- Both extend `TriggerHandler` framework for consistent behavior

---

## Test Scenarios & Validation

**✅ Audits Successfully Created:**
- Opportunity changes to "Qualification" → During-Sale audit (7 days)
- Opportunity changes to "Closed Won" → Post-Sale audit (5 days)  
- Lead changes to "Working - Contacted" → Pre-Sale audit (10 days)
- Lead changes to "Closed - Not Converted" → Pre-Sale audit (10 days)

**✅ Audits Correctly NOT Created:**
- Opportunity changes to "Prospecting" (not in metadata configuration)
- Lead changes to "Qualified" (not in metadata configuration)  
- No actual change (StageName/Status remains the same)
- Configuration exists but IsActive__c = false

**✅ Participant Creation Validated:**
- Opportunity audits: Owner + Account Owner + Account Contacts
- Lead audits: Lead Owner only
- No duplicate participants created
- Proper role assignment ('Owner' vs 'Client')

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### **Alert & Notification System**
*This represents the next phase of development to provide proactive audit management.*

**Proposed Features:**
- **Scheduled Apex Job**: Daily scan for overdue audits
- **Email Notifications**: Automated alerts to audit participants and managers
- **Dashboard Components**: Real-time audit status visibility
- **Workflow Rules**: Status change notifications and escalations
- **Custom Reports**: Overdue audit reports for management review

**Implementation Approach:**
- Batch Apex class to identify overdue audits
- Email templates for different notification types  
- Custom Lightning components for audit management
- Reports and dashboards for audit analytics

**Benefits:**
- Proactive audit management
- Reduced manual oversight
- Improved audit completion rates
- Executive visibility into audit performance

---

## Scalability & Maintenance

### **Designed for Growth**
- **New Objects**: Add Quote, Order, or custom objects by extending Parent_Type__c picklist
- **New Audit Rules**: Admin can add AuditConfig__mdt records without code changes
- **New Participant Types**: Extend Role__c picklist for additional audit roles
- **Performance**: Bulk-safe triggers and efficient SOQL queries

### **Administrative Control**
- **Metadata-Driven**: Business rules managed via Custom Metadata Types
- **No Code Changes**: Audit configurations managed by admins
- **Flexible Timing**: ExpectedAuditDays__c customizable per business process
- **Enable/Disable**: IsActive__c flag allows temporary rule suspension

### **Technical Architecture**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Service classes handle business logic
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with comprehensive logging  
- **Security**: Proper FLS checks and sharing model compliance
- **Maintainability**: Clear documentation and consistent coding patterns
