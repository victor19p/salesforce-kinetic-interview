# Action Plan: Scalable Audit Trail for Sales Process in Salesforce

## 1. Overview

Design and implement a scalable solution to record audit events for any sales-related object (e.g., Lead, Opportunity, Quote, Order) in Salesforce.  
The system will support automation, alerting, and future expansion to new sales objects.

## 2. Object and Fields to Create

### **Generic Custom Object: Audit__c**

| Field Name                  | Data Type                   | Description |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Parent_Type__c              | Picklist                    | Parent object type (Lead, Opportunity, Quote, Order, etc.) |
| Parent_Lead__c              | Lookup (Lead)               | Reference to Lead (if Parent_Type__c = Lead) |
| Parent_Opportunity__c       | Lookup (Opportunity)        | Reference to Opportunity (if Parent_Type__c = Opportunity) |
| Audit_Status__c             | Picklist                    | Audit status (Draft, In Progress, Completed, Overdue, Cancelled) |
| Audit_Type__c               | Picklist                    | Audit type (Pre-Sale, During-Sale, Post-Sale, etc.) |
| Expected_Audit_Date__c      | Date                        | Planned date for the audit |
| Actual_Audit_Date__c        | Date                        | Date the audit was performed |
| Comments__c                 | Long Text                   | Notes and observations |
| Overdue__c                  | Formula/Checkbox            | Indicates if the audit is overdue |
| Original_Owner__c           | Lookup (User)               | Original owner of the parent record |

---

### **Junction Object: AuditParticipant__c**

| Field Name           | Data Type                 | Description                                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Audit__c             | Lookup (Audit__c)        | Reference to the Audit record                           |
| Contact__c           | Lookup (Contact)         | Reference to the Contact (external participant)         |
| User__c              | Lookup (User)            | Reference to the User (internal participant)            |
| Role__c              | Picklist                 | Role in the audit (Auditor, Stakeholder, Client, etc.)  |
| Comments__c          | Long Text                | Optional notes                                          |

**Validation Rule:**  
Require that either `User__c` or `Contact__c` is populated, but not both.

## 3. Automation Proposal

### **A. Record-Triggered Flow (Base Option)**
- Configure a Flow triggered by status/stage changes in Lead, Opportunity, Quote, or Order.
- Flow creates an Audit__c record, populates Parent_Type, fills the correct lookup, and associates participants via AuditParticipant__c.
- **Pros:** Admin-friendly, quick to deploy.
- **Cons:** Limited for complex bulk operations or advanced logic.

### **B. Apex Trigger + Handler Framework (Recommended)**
- Develop Apex triggers on relevant objects (Lead, Opportunity, etc.) for key field changes.
- Handler logic processes events, creates Audit__c records, populates fields, links participants.
- **Pros:** High scalability and flexibility, robust error handling.
- **Cons:** Requires development and testing.

## 4. Alerts & Notification System

- **Visual flags:** Overdue__c field highlights records needing attention.
- **Internal Salesforce notifications:** Tasks, Chatter posts, or standard notifications for overdue audits.
- **Email alerts:** Automated emails to owners, auditors, or managers for overdue or pending audits.
- **Reports/Dashboards:** Unified dashboards for all audit types across all parent objects.

---

## 5. Implementation Steps

1. **Design and create the generic Audit__c object and fields.**
2. **Create the AuditParticipant__c junction object with validation rule.**
3. **Build automation:**
   - Implement Record-Triggered Flows and/or Apex Trigger logic.
   - Ensure logic supports multiple parent types.
4. **Configure alerts and notifications:**
   - Formula fields, email templates, notification rules.
   - Build reports and dashboards for audit status tracking.
5. **Testing:**
   - Validate in sandbox/dev org with various scenarios and parent objects.
6. **Training & documentation:**
   - Prepare user/admin guides and training materials.
7. **Deployment & monitoring:**
   - Roll out in production.
   - Monitor for performance and user feedback.

## 6. Scalability & Future-Proofing

- Easily extend to new Salesforce objects (Quotes, Orders, Cases, custom sales objects) by adding new Parent_Type values and lookups.
- Centralized reporting and logic ensure long-term maintainability.
- Periodic review and improvement based on business evolution.
