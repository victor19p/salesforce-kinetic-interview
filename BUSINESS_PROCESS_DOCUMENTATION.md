## Detailed Business Processes

### **Process 1: Opportunity Audit Management**

#### **Trigger Conditions**
The system automatically creates audits when an Opportunity advances to these stages:
- **Qualification**: During-Sale audit (7 days to complete)
- **Proposal/Price Quote**: During-Sale audit (7 days to complete)
- **Negotiation/Review**: During-Sale audit (7 days to complete)
- **Closed Won**: Post-Sale audit (5 days to complete)
- **Closed Lost**: Post-Sale audit (5 days to complete)

#### **Automatic Participant Assignment**

**For All Opportunity Audits**:
1. **Opportunity Owner** (Role: Owner)
   - Primary responsibility for audit completion
   - Receives all audit-related notifications
   - Can delegate but remains accountable

2. **Account Owner** (Role: Owner) - *if different from Opportunity Owner*
   - Secondary ownership responsibility
   - Provides account context and history
   - Collaborates on audit completion

3. **Account Contacts** (Role: Client)
   - External stakeholders in the audit process
   - May be requested to provide information
   - Receive relevant audit communications

    K --> M[Manager Notified]
    L --> G
    I --> N[Audit Closed Successfully]
    M --> O[Manager Reviews with Owner]
    O --> G
```

#### **Owner Responsibilities**

**Upon Audit Creation**:
1. **Review Audit Details**: Understand scope and requirements
2. **Validate Participants**: Ensure all relevant parties are included
3. **Plan Audit Activities**: Schedule review meetings and documentation
4. **Set Expectations**: Communicate timeline to all participants

**During Audit Execution**:
1. **Document Activities**: Record all audit-related activities in Comments
2. **Collaborate with Participants**: Engage Account Owner and Contacts as needed
3. **Address Issues**: Resolve any findings or discrepancies
4. **Monitor Timeline**: Track progress against expected completion date

**Upon Audit Completion**:
1. **Update Status**: Change Audit Status to 'Completed'
2. **Record Actual Date**: Enter Actual_Audit_Date__c
3. **Summarize Findings**: Document key outcomes in Comments
4. **Share Results**: Communicate findings to management if required

### **Process 2: Lead Audit Management**

#### **Trigger Conditions**
The system automatically creates audits when a Lead changes to these statuses:
- **Working - Contacted**: Pre-Sale audit (10 days to complete)
- **Closed - Not Converted**: Pre-Sale audit (10 days to complete)

#### **Automatic Participant Assignment**

**For All Lead Audits**:
1. **Lead Owner** (Role: Owner)
   - Sole responsibility for audit completion
   - Reviews lead engagement and qualification activities
   - Documents conversion analysis (for non-converted leads)

#### **Business Process Flow**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Lead Status Updated] --> B{Status Requires Audit?}
    B -->|Yes| C[System Creates Audit Record]
    B -->|No| Z[End - No Action Required]
    C --> D[Lead Owner Assigned as Participant]
    D --> E[Owner Notified of New Audit]
    E --> F[Owner Reviews Lead History]
    F --> G[Owner Conducts Audit Review]
    G --> H{Audit Complete?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Owner Updates Status to 'Completed']
    H -->|No| J{Past Due Date?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Audit Flagged as Overdue]
    J -->|No| L[Continue Audit Work]
    K --> M[Manager Notified]
    L --> G
    I --> N[Audit Closed Successfully]
    M --> O[Manager Reviews with Owner]
    O --> G
```

#### **Lead Owner Responsibilities**

**For Working - Contacted Audits**:
1. **Validate Engagement**: Confirm meaningful contact was made
2. **Review Qualification**: Assess lead quality and fit
3. **Document Activities**: Record all engagement activities

2. **Document Lessons**: Record insights for future improvement
3. **Validate Decision**: Confirm closure was appropriate
4. **Report Trends**: Share patterns with management

### **Process 3: Overdue Audit Management**

#### **Overdue Detection Logic**
An audit is automatically flagged as overdue when:
- Expected Audit Date has passed (TODAY() > Expected_Audit_Date__c)
- Audit Status is NOT 'Completed' or 'Cancelled'
- The Overdue__c formula field displays as TRUE

#### **Escalation Process**

**Day 1 (Overdue)**:
- Audit Owner receives automated reminder
- Overdue flag visible on audit record
- Manager can view overdue audits via reports

**Day 3 (Significantly Overdue)**:
- Manager receives escalation notification
- Audit appears on management dashboard
- Required review between Manager and Owner

**Day 7 (Critical Overdue)**:
- Senior management notification
- Formal review process initiated
- Audit may be reassigned or cancelled

#### **Management Actions for Overdue Audits**

**Manager Responsibilities**:
1. **Review Audit Details**: Understand scope and complexity
2. **Assess Obstacles**: Identify blockers preventing completion
3. **Provide Support**: Offer resources or guidance to Owner
4. **Consider Reassignment**: If Owner unavailable or overloaded
5. **Approve Extensions**: Modify expected date if justified
6. **Document Decisions**: Record rationale for any changes
