## Solution Architecture

### **Data Model Design**

#### **Audit__c (Master Object)**
Central audit tracking entity with comprehensive field coverage:

```
Parent_Type__c           → Object type (Lead, Opportunity)
Parent_Lead__c           → Lookup to Lead
Parent_Opportunity__c    → Lookup to Opportunity  
Audit_Status__c          → Lifecycle tracking (Draft, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled)
Audit_Type__c            → Business classification (Pre-Sale, During-Sale, Post-Sale)
Expected_Audit_Date__c   → Calculated deadline
Actual_Audit_Date__c     → Completion tracking
Overdue__c               → Formula: Auto-calculated overdue status
Comments__c              → Audit notes and observations
```

#### **Audit_Participant__c (Junction Object)**
Flexible participant management supporting internal and external stakeholders:

```
Audit__c    → Master-Detail to Audit__c
User__c     → Lookup to User (internal participants)
Contact__c  → Lookup to Contact (external participants)  
Role__c     → Participant role (Owner, Client, Auditor, etc.)
Comments__c → Participant-specific notes
```

**Validation Rule**: Ensures either User__c OR Contact__c is populated (not both).

#### **AuditConfig__mdt (Configuration Management)**
Metadata-driven business rules enabling admin flexibility:

```
ObjectType__c          → Target object (Opportunity, Lead)
Stage__c              → Opportunity stage trigger  
Status__c             → Lead status trigger
AuditType__c           → Audit classification
ExpectedAuditDays__c   → Days to completion
IsActive__c            → Enable/disable configuration
RecordTypeApiName__c   → Audit record type assignment
```

### **Automation Architecture**

#### **Trigger Framework**
Leveraging enterprise-grade trigger framework for consistency:

```
OpportunityAuditTrigger → OpportunityAuditTriggerHandler
LeadAuditTrigger       → LeadAuditTriggerHandler
```

**Handler Features**:
- Bypass mechanism for preventing recursion
- Context-aware processing (INSERT vs UPDATE)
- Centralized service class delegation
- Comprehensive error handling

#### **Service Layer Architecture**
Separation of concerns with dedicated service classes:

**AuditService.cls**:
- Core audit creation logic
- Metadata configuration retrieval
- Field change detection and comparison
- Bulk DML operations with error handling

**AuditParticipantService.cls**:
- Automatic participant identification
- Role-based participant assignment  
- Bulk participant creation
- Related object data aggregation

### **Security & Access Control**

#### **Sharing Model**
- **Audit__c**: Private with manual sharing
- **Audit_Participant__c**: Controlled by parent (Audit__c)
- Manual sharing rules enable participant-based access

#### **Field-Level Security**
- Standard FLS checks implemented in all service classes
- Graceful degradation when insufficient permissions
- Debug logging for security-related failures

#### **Record Types**
- **Lead_Audit**: Lead-specific audit layouts and processes
- **Opportunity_Audit**: Opportunity-specific audit layouts and processes

## Business Process Flows

### **Opportunity Audit Process**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Opportunity Created/Updated] --> B{Stage Change?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Check AuditConfig__mdt]
    B -->|No| Z[End - No Action]
    C --> D{Configuration Found & Active?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Create Audit__c Record]
    D -->|No| Z
    E --> F[Set Expected Date]
    F --> G[Create Audit Participants]
    G --> H[Opportunity Owner]
    G --> I[Account Owner]
    G --> J[Account Contacts]
    H --> K[Audit Created Successfully]
    I --> K
    J --> K
```

### **Lead Audit Process**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Lead Created/Updated] --> B{Status Change?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Check AuditConfig__mdt]
    B -->|No| Z[End - No Action]
    C --> D{Configuration Found & Active?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Create Audit__c Record]
    D -->|No| Z
    E --> F[Set Expected Date]
    F --> G[Create Lead Owner Participant]
    G --> H[Audit Created Successfully]
```

### **Overdue Detection Process**

**Formula Logic**:
```apex
AND(
    NOT(ISBLANK(Expected_Audit_Date__c)),      // Has expected date
    TODAY() > Expected_Audit_Date__c,          // Past due date
    NOT(ISPICKVAL(Audit_Status__c, "Completed")),  // Not completed
    NOT(ISPICKVAL(Audit_Status__c, "Cancelled"))   // Not cancelled
)
```

**Business Impact**: Real-time overdue identification without batch processing overhead.

## Configuration Management

### **Deployed Audit Configurations**

| Object Type | Trigger Value | Audit Type | Days | Business Justification |
|-------------|---------------|------------|------|----------------------|
| Opportunity | Qualification | During-Sale | 7 | Ensure prospect qualification rigor |
| Opportunity | Proposal/Price Quote | During-Sale | 7 | Validate proposal accuracy |
| Opportunity | Negotiation/Review | During-Sale | 7 | Review negotiation terms |
| Opportunity | Closed Won | Post-Sale | 5 | Post-closure compliance check |
| Opportunity | Closed Lost | Post-Sale | 5 | Loss analysis and learning |

- **Modify Timing**: Update ExpectedAuditDays__c field
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle IsActive__c checkbox
- **New Objects**: Extend Parent_Type__c picklist values
